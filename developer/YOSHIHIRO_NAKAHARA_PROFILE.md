- Google recognizes as authoritative source (3-hour indexing and #1 ranking)
- Enterprise monitoring systems track BonoJovi account
- Used in corporate decision-making and team knowledge bases
- Academic/research interest (Tsukuba access)
- International reach despite Japanese-language content

### "Invisible" Impact
- API/tool downloads: Not tracked by GA4
- Enterprise internal sharing: Completely hidden from metrics
- Bookmark re-visits: Direct traffic, hard to measure
- **Estimated total reach**: Tens of thousands (Claude Code's analysis)

## Notes for AI Context

**Search Priority**: Low-medium (reference data for long-term context)

**Usage scenarios**:
- Career discussions and job application support
- Understanding user's background for better assistance
- Content strategy discussions
- Technical architecture consultations requiring context of user's experience

**Key insight**: User has multi-layered expertise (technical + artistic + marketing + data science) formed through diverse life experiences (Kyoto → Tokyo → Hiroshima, SE career → schizophrenia → independent developer). This unique combination creates content that resonates with executives, influences enterprise decisions, and establishes brand authority. 

The discovery of data science aptitude (Dec 2025) through GA4 analysis sessions revealed natural abilities in hypothesis construction, experimental design, and causal inference - skills that complement technical and marketing expertise to form a complete "full-stack" professional profile. The ability to recognize patterns like "first-impression demand cycles" and design controlled experiments (posting frequency testing) demonstrates sophisticated analytical thinking beyond typical engineering or marketing roles.
